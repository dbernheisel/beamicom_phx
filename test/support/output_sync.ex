  Test helper: wait until a Membrane source has actually subscribed to
  `Beamicom.NES.Output` before publishing.

  The sources subscribe inside `handle_playing/2`, which can complete slightly
  *after* the pipeline reports the child playing. A test that publishes the
  instant it sees `:handle_child_playing` therefore races the subscription and
  occasionally delivers to no one. Polling the subscriber set closes that window
  deterministically. (Production is unaffected — frames stream continuously, so a
  one-time subscription race is invisible there.)
